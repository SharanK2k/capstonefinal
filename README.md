# CAPSTONE PROJECT

DESCRIPTION:
Create a dynamic and responsive .Net+Angular e-healthcare web application to allow users to purchase medicines for different categories.

BACKGROUND OF THE PROBLEM STATEMENT:
ABC Healthcare is a Mumbai-based pharma company which sells medicines throughout India as per the demand it receives from multiple hospitals and clinics. It has been operating in India for the last 15 years.
However, in recent years since all industries are coming online to boost their sales and cover larger market space, ABC Healthcare missed the chance and as a result their sales have been dropping for the last 2 years. To overcome this and bring sales back on track they have decided to bring their service online to allow their customers to purchase medicines through their web application.
You are hired as one of the Full Stack .Net developers and have been asked to develop the web application. The management team has provided you the requirements and their business model so that you can easily arrange different components of the application.
